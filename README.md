# Rick and Morty Minesweeper

Implementation of classic minesweeper skinned like Rick & Morty hosted [here](https://rickandmortyminesweeper.com). The original game was built mostly in a night with vanilla JS, the source code for which is located in the ```og_files``` directory (I know it's bad code that's why I redesigned it).

Built using:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org)

## Getting started

To start the application in debug mode, use ```npm start``` inside the top-level directory. Building for production can be done using ```npm run build```.
